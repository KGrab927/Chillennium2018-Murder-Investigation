Victorian Woman Dialogue:{
//from the perspective that the player is speaking to the woman as different characters

	if speaking to the french cook {
	
	-first interaction: "Out of the kitchen? What reason does a rat have to leave its hole?"
	
		A. "Mademoiselle, please, I simply wish to know how the party recieved the dinner. 
		Did they find it to be excellent?"
			
			Victorian Woman: "Hmf, excellent? I dare say that a man died at that dinner. You wouldn't know anything about that, would you?"
				
				A."You think I had anything to do with that, Mademe? Certainly not! I was in the kitchen preparing the feast!"
					
					Victorian Woman: "Yes, you were in the kitchen, that cannot be disputed. But the matter at hand is not your food, but the man that died at the table."
					
					A. "Oui, oui. What is it you suggest then? If you do not suspect my cooking?"
						
						Victorian Woman: "Oh I haven't the slightest idea. It wasn't me, but that Money Bags Mcgee, 
						I heard he has a competing company with the dead party. Maybe you should speak to him, 
						instead of bothering an old woman past her bedtime."
						
						A. "When does a distingushed woman retire?"
						
							 Victorian Woman: "Precisely at midnight, staying up any later isn't good for my complexion."
								[END]
						
						B. "Oui, Oui."
							[END]
						
				B. "A man died? You cannot blame my meal. Afterall, it was excellent!"
				
					Victorian Woman: "Hmf, the meal was etible. I suppose I can say that. After all, I am still here. 
					Now then, are we done?"
					[END]
	
		B. "A rat?! I say mademe! Coming from an old croan who probably did the deed herself!"
			
			Victorian Woman: "I have no business talking to such a foul mouthed accuser. Leave me in peace servant!"
				[END]
				
		C. "Psst. Do you know who did it? Who killed me?"
			
			Victorian Woman: "What on earth are you talking about? Are you mad? Have you gotten into the absynth? Or heaven forbid, have you forgotten that you are a FRENCH CHEF?
			Do not speak to me until you have regained your senses!"
			[END]
	}

	
	if speaking to the Money Bags {
	
	-upon interaction: "Ah, Mr. Money Bags Mcgee. How has your evening been thus far? Aside from the obvious plight of course."
	
		A. "Mhm hm hm, M-why excellent, simply excellent. A pity what happened earlier, but the sooner the police arrive the sooner things will be sorted out."
			
				Victorian Woman: "The authorities should help to solve some of this, true."
				
					A. "Back to more amicable discussion, how are your relations?"
						
						Victorian Woman: "They are getting along fine, my grand daughter in particular. 
						If you should know, she was being considerably courted by the dead party. 
						He may have been in possession of a company, but I could never have allowed her to marry someone without any official status. 
						The blood of the family must be maintained!"
						
							A. "It seems this man's untimely death comes as a benefit to you. "
							
								Victorian Woman: "Nothing more than a coincidence. Though I must say, it comes as a benefit to you as well. With competition looming in the air,
								I'd say you would be just as glad to get rid of it."
								
									A. "You think that I would resort to such matters because I cannot handle some friendly competition? Hogwash!"
									
										Victorial Woman: "Indeed. What can be said is that a man is dead, and someone is to blame. Have you been to the kitchen lately?
										I have heard from the staff that it is in particular disarray."
										[END]
										
									B. "A rather convenient coincidence all the same. I think you did it!"
									
										Victorian Woman: "Until the authorities arrive I will have nothing more to say to you."
										[END]
		
					B. "I can see this conversation going no further. I have some money to count, and business to conduct."
					
						Victorian Woman: "Hfm, there is no need to be so unpleasant. It was you who came to me, not the other way around."
						[END]
					
		B. "Dreadful, absolutely dreadful! Have you seen the table setting? It is not in the least bit acceptable!"
			
				Victorian Woman: "Yes, yes, I do agree, but perhaps you should take these matters up with the chef. Isn't he the one who planned the dinner?"
				[END]

		C. "Money, money, I have company things to think of--"
			
				Victorian Woman: "Excuse me? It would seem that you are babbling and have forgotten you head. At this point I'm not even sure that it is attatched to your shoulders!"
				[END]

French Chef:{

	if speaking to Money Bags Mcgee:{
		
	-upon interaction: "Oui oui, hon hon. A guest of my dinner! How was it?"
		
		A."It was excellent. Is everyone just as satisfied?"
		
			French chef: "Non monsuier. The bastard who died was not. It is just as well, that is what happens when you insult french cooking!!"
			
				A."It seems you feel strongly about the issue. What about the meal wasn't to his liking? I myself couldn't find a flaw in it!"
				
					French Chef: "Where to begin monsuier? His discontent started with the first course! The monster insulted my baguettes, saying that they where soft! Insolent pig."
					
						A. "The baguettes you say? Why I thought they were perfect! A connoisuer myself I have had few that were baked finer. But the first course, I mean, it's a wonder he made it through dinner!"
						
							French Chef: "What do you mean monsuier? He died in between the second and third courses. Were you not sitting at the table with him?"
							
								A. "Oh-- Why yes I was present, I just had indulged in too much wine and was too intent on the fabulous meal that you had served to even notice any of the other guests!"
								
									French Chef: "Too much wine you say? Hon hon. Are you not a man? There was barely any wine at the table at all! A tragedy not to have the correct glasses."
									
										A. "A shame to be true. Where is a good host when you need one?"
											
											French Chef: "Hon hon. I would check the master bedroom if I were you. Surely someone as foul as that has something to hide."
											[END]
						
								B. "I wasn't paying all that much attention. I was too busy eyeing my own gold pocket watch to even notice."
								[END]
						
						B. "Hm hm, they were rather soft--"
							
							French Chef: "AWAY WITH YOU!!"
							[END]
						
				B."So you killed the dead party?"
					
					French Chef: "Certainly not! He brought it upon himself, but I did not kill him. I was in the kitchen! While you lounged and enjoyed my meal I had work to do!"
					[END]
				
		B. "Entirely too much salt! You really don't know how to balance a meal."
			
			French Chef: "Imb√©cile! With such disregard you should join our unfortunate guest!"
			[END]
			
		C. "Hon Hon, Louis the XIV could not have eaten better, non oui."
		
			French Chef: "Do you insult me or are you drunk? It seems that you have forgotten who standing here is french!"
			[END]

	if speaking to Victorian Woman:(
	
		-upon interaction: "Good evening mademoiselle, I trust you found the dinner to your liking?"
		
			A. "It was fine, thank you. Although I must say, one of us did not think so."
			
				French chef: "I should say not! That man should have kept to himself when it comes to my craft!"
					
					A. "I venture to ask, you were in the kitchen for the entire dinner, correct? It seems as though you have something against this person in particular."
						
						French chef: "Certainly! You cannot possibly claim that I was not in the kitchen! If I had left, you would never have been served! Not even the wine would have made it to your table!"
						
							A. "I claim nothing in particular, your services for the evening were excellent."
							
								French chef: "Merci. If you will excuse me mademe, I must return to my work. The kitchen needs to be seen to. Hon hon."
								[END]
	
							B. "You may not have left the kitchen but your meal did."
							
								French chef: "I will have nothing more to say to you!"
								[END]
	
			B. "I wouldn't say it was the finest meal that I have ever indulged in, but I suppose for some it was edible."
			
				French chef: "Impertinent woman! My talents are wasted on you!"
				[END]
			
			C. *attempting to sound old* "My teeth have a hard timem, and I've lost a marble--*"

		-upon interaction: "Yes? For whatever could you want? I am a very busy man."
			
			A. "Hon hon monsuier, as you know I've been busy the entire evening, but I was wondering if you had taken time to venture the estate?"
			
				$$: "Oh-ho! Yes, it is important for a man to know his competition. I haven't left a single drawer unchecked."
				
					A. "Anything to catch your interest?"
					
						$$: "Hm...Well nothing too terribly interesting I suppose. Most everything in this house is all so drab anyways. 
						I did find an odd bottle in the kitchen. A wonder what it was doing there."
	
							A. "Hon hon, a bottle you say? Why it's a kitchen! What is odd about that?"
								
								$$: "Well the label is smudged. Even with the finest schooling in the whole of Bristol I can't for the life of me read it. 
								Who know's what was in the bottle. It's empty now..."
								[END]
						
					B. "Hon hon hon, I am sure you came across the surprise in the closet. It's not worth missing!"
					
						$$: "That was you?? I dread to even think of what you did to the food!"
						[END]
					
			B. "Very busy? You know nothing of BUSY. I have been prepping your meal since early this morning!"
			
				$$: "Hm? Ah, yes yes, run along now and bother someone else."

			C. "My grand daughter was going to marry that horrible man!"
				
				$$: "Have you lost your senses? You sound like the Grand Dutchess!"
				[END]
	}

	
	
	if speaking to Victorian Woman:(
	
		-upon interaction: "If it isn't the Grand Dutchess herself. What brings you to seek my most important company?"
			
			A."Your humility knows no bounds. I do not wish to discuss formalities but the morbid matter at hand. A man has died at the table, and we haven't any idea who it could have been!"
				
				$$:"I can assure you it wasn't me! 
				We might have had competing markets, but it was nothing to kill the man over! Do not mishear me, I don't believe it was you either. 
				I am sure that you loved your grand daughter too much to have caused her this much unhappiness."
				
					A. "So you agree that it wasn't either of us? Well then that only leaves the Frenchman."
					
						$$: "Yes, it would seem that he is particularly passionate about his cooking, and that the guest in question had words to say about it."
						
							A. "Did he? Is that a strong enough motive? To insult someone's food?"
							
								$$: "Just as strong of a motive as to kill someone over family pride."
								[END]
		
					B. "I still accuse you. Only a man such as yourself with his head that far up his own rear could have done something such as this!"
						
						$$: "I will have you know that my behind is cleaner than a polished diamond. Mh hm."
						[END]

							
			B. "Your company isn't the least bit important and I will dare to say that you are an arse."
			
				$$: *wipes a shed tear with a pound* "I say!"
